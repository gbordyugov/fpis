# My read through some of the chapters of [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

Open/skipped exercises:
  - Exercise 7.2: I had no idea
  - Exercise 7.7
  - Exercise 8.15 is a larger project
  - Exercise 8.20 is a larger project

2018-08-22: I'm stuck a bit with implementing the JSON parser of
Chapter 9. I feel uncomfortable coding it without having a working
Parser implementation. So I'm going to skip Exercises 9.9 and 9.10 for
the sake of implementing a working Parser first, which I could
actually run and play with to get a feeling how it works. Then I will
build the JSON parser step by step.
