# My read through some of the chapters of [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

Open/skipped exercises:
  - Exercise 7.2: I had no idea
  - Exercise 7.7
  - Exercise 8.15 is a larger project
  - Exercise 8.20 is a larger project
  - Exercise 9.10 and 9.11 are open-ended ones
  - Exercise 9.12 -- I just jumped to the implementation proposed in the book
  - Exercises 9.17 - 9.18

For Chapter 7, I implemented an additional tracing of the max fork depth,
which is passed along with the result of Par

For Chapter 9, I implemented an S-Expression parser before my take on a JSON
parser.
